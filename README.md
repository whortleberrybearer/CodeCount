# CodeCount

A simple console program that counts the number of words in files.

## Background

While watching an conference session, the speaker (unfortunately I can't remember who it was) said if you look at the most common words in code, is should tell you about the program / what it does.  If you can't, the program may not be well written.

Atleast, thats what I think the gist was, I was a long time ago.
